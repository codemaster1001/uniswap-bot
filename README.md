# Univ2-Tri-Arb
This code actually still works! Just git clone the repository and use `cargo run -r`. If you want to check taxes or ensure the pairs are valid, just run `cargo run -r load`, This will make a fresh db.jso>

### Use case
For learning and reusing components such as a uni v2 token tax checker, a generalized framework for arbitrage, etc...

### This is a fork of https://github.com/duoxehyon/univ2-tri-arb.git, I add V3 Dexes and some Other improvements
